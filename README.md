# RISC-V 32
RISC-V Single Cycle Processor using 32-bit Instructions/Memory, created as the final project for the IEEE CUSB Digital Design Workshop.

The *program.txt* contains the machine code for a Fibonacci sequence generation program, which stores the values into the data RAM starting with the very first position in memory and incrememnting up.

The following simulation snapshot shows the code in motion:

The other *.txt* files are used in the testbenches to test memory functionality, make sure they are placed in the project folder for them to be read properly.

Programs used for this project:

 - VS Code for editing and writing code.
 - QuestaSim for compilation and simulation.
 - Vivado for synthesis and implementation.
